## Project Overview
My Travel map is a culmination of the places that I have traveled to.
Using JavaScript I have seperated each travel location into sections: Family holidays, personal holidays, sporting events and finally places where I want to visit next.

A link to the live website can be found [here](https://jayage.github.io/my-travel-map/)

## UX
### User Stories

- As a user I want to, be able to interact with the map to view different options available.


### 1. Strategy

- Create a website that showcases 
- Create an enjoyable and easy to use website.

### 2. Scope

- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML & CSS and JavaScript
- Easy to navigate through.

### 3. Structure

As the website was built on being a single page with multiple accordian options. The accordian options will seperate the different sections like family holidays and sporting events.



### 4. Skeleton

- The website wireframe can be found [here](assets/documents/travelmap-wireframe.png)

### 5. Surface
The overall UX is clean and clear to be easilly navigateable.

## Testing



## Deployment
### This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

- All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/Jayage/Jabba).
- Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
- Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
- Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
- There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
- The code can be run locally through clone or download.
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
- The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
