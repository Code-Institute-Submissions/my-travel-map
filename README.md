## Project Overview
My Travel map is a culmination of the places that I have traveled to.
Using JavaScript I have seperated each travel location into sections: Family holidays, personal holidays, sporting events and finally places where I want to visit next.

A link to the live website can be found [here](https://jayage.github.io/my-travel-map/)

## UX
### User Stories

* **People with no travel plans in mind (yet) or deciding where to go:**
    - I want to get inspiration for my travel exerience.
    - I want to be able to understand what kind of travel experience I am being offered and explore it from the comfort of my own home. 
    - I want to use interactive elements of the website.

* **People who are travelling in the area**
    - I want to to use the map to find exciting places to visit.
    - To have an idea of what places to visit based off the places that I had visited.

### Strategy

- To enable easy access to the information needed to plan their trip.
- To showcase the best places to visit.

### Scope

- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML & CSS and JavaScript
- Easy to navigate.

### Structure

As the website was built on being a single page with multiple accordian options. The accordian options will seperate the different sections like family holidays and sporting events.


### Skeleton

- The website wireframe can be found [here](assets/documents/travelmap-wireframe.png)

### Surface
The overall UX is clean and clear to be easilly navigateable. 

### Colors:
The base scheme was chosen from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). Some different colour tones were 
also chosen to make the website more elegant.

## Testing
My code has been put through the following:

### Functionality

#### Button Locations
 - Each button functionality was tested to provide the coordinates for each map marker correctly.

#### Responsiveness
- The website was tested on Google Mobile friendly and passed.

#### Bugs & fixes

- There is an issue that the map sometimes doesn't load correctly after a hard refresh of the website.
- Refreshing solves the problem.


## Deployment
### This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

- All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/Jayage/Jabba).
- Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
- Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
- Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
- There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
- The code can be run locally through clone or download.
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
- The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.


## Credits
